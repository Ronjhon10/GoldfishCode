# GoldfishCode
This is the repository for the Goldfish Vending Machine on my youtube channel 
It gets a little messy and might not work perfect depending on your setup
The Arduino board used was an Arduino Nano with an ATmega328P
As in the videos 2 power supplies were used one 5v for the board and another 12v for most everything else
+++I do not claim this as an original work+++
Much of the code for the coin acceptor came from Marios Ideas: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_YUPxLXSRu_4_zCO27kRww
Thanks for stopping by this untraditional readme
